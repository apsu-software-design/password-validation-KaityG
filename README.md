# Credit

All credit goes to the University of Wisconsin for the format of this homework assignment and the survey questions below.

# Setup and Review

This repo contains code for the password validator. The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

## Did you find the JavaScript Learning Tutor useful? If so, what about the tool made it useful? If not, why not?
> I didn't because I was unable to use it. I used a collection of other online tutorials to complete this assignment.


## Do you have any suggestions on how the JavaScript Learning Tutor might be improved?
> I do not. 


## Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!).
> Yes. I recieved help from Johnathan Dickson with setting up software and understanding the assignment. I also used online tutorials. 
There were a lot of quick searches, so I cannot remember the specific sources I used. However, I used common ones like GeeksForGeeks.


## Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
> This assignment took a couple of hours in totality. Most of the time was spent searching how to implement JavaScript and Git, installing everything correctly,
and understanding the assignment. The time to code took the shortest time. 


## On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment?
> 7 only because I had very limited knowledge on how to use Typescript, JavaScript, Node.js, and Git. 


## Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better?
> An issue is to be very careful about how you install everything, and students should be warned that this assignment comes with a lot of trial and error unrelated to coding.
Therefore, everyone should start as soon as possible because you will more than likely need to troubleshoot issues not readily found on online.
